# Traffic Light Simulator â€“ Stage 2: Set up the traffic light

---

## ðŸ§  Description

What is a system without parameters? The traffic light should work the way users want it. Everything is simple â€” provide input and get the corresponding program's output.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

In this stage, after the welcoming line, ask the users to `input` the desired `number` of roads and `input` the `interval` at which the roads should open/close. After each request, read the value that a user provides.

Next, implement a looped selection menu. The loop (as well as the program execution) ends when a user selects `0` as the desired option. Any other option (`1`, `2`, `3`) prints an informational text on the action performed (`add`, `delete`, `system`) for each option.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

```text
Welcome to the traffic management system!
Input the number of roads: > 5
Input the interval: > 3
Menu:
1. Add road
2. Delete road
3. Open system
0. Quit
> 1
Road added
Menu:
1. Add road
2. Delete road
3. Open system
0. Quit
> 2
Road deleted
Menu:
1. Add road
2. Delete road
3. Open system
0. Quit
> 3
System opened
Menu:
1. Add road
2. Delete road
3. Open system
0. Quit
> 0
Bye!
```
