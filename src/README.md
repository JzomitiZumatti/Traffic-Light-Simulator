# Traffic Light Simulator â€“ Stage 1: Open the control panel

---

## ðŸ§  Description

Let's output the starting menu that greets users and shows them a list of four possible options. We will use this menu in later stages.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

As a start, develop a simple program that prints six non-empty lines to the output.

- Being a very polite program, it greets users on the first line with the `Welcome` substring and tells them that they've just started `traffic management system`.
- The following line is the list's title, with `Menu` substring.
- After that, finally, display the list line-by-line in exact order, indexing and substrings:

```text
1. Add
2. Delete
3. System
0. Quit
```
In further stages we will control the traffic light system with these actions.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

Example:

```text
Welcome to the traffic management system!
Menu:
1. Add
2. Delete
3. System
0. Quit
```
